# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project is designed to create a working web page that offers a place to store work day events and track which hour they need to be completted and adjust its UI accordingly to the hour. The goal is for the user to store in their local storage notes at certain hours so whenever they return to view their planner, they can see what notes they have left and remove them once they are completted. Unfortunately, I was unable to finish this project and have taken the necessary steps to properly complete it like setting up a tutor session.
